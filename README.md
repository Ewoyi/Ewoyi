# Welcome to My GitHub Profile 👋

## Introduction

👨‍💼 I'm a data enthusiast with a background in engineering management, and I have a unique journey that brought me into the world of technology. Prior to my current path, I worked as an electrical technician in a port operating company in Nigeria, where I gained practical experience and developed a strong work ethic.

🌍 What ignited my enthusiasm for technology was a single tweet that shared a staggering fact: 90% of the world's data was generated within the past 2 years. This revelation underscored the transformative impact of technology in our world and made me realize that the world is rapidly going digital. I knew I wanted to be a part of this amazing shift.

🚀 To pursue my passion for technology, I embarked on a journey of self-improvement. I started learning coding languages, attending technology seminars, and continuously pushing my boundaries. A pivotal moment in my career was when I discovered the digital skills program by BrainStation. It presented a unique opportunity to further capitalize on my passion for technology and take my skills to the next level.

💡 In summary, my background in engineering management and my passion for innovation and technology have driven me to continuously seek growth in this field. I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to discussing how my experiences align with your organization's goals and vision.

Let's explore the digital future together!
